# github-authentication

Add Github Authentication to your Graphcool project üéÅ


## Getting Started

### 1. Add the template to your Graphcool service

```sh
graphcool add-template graphcool/templates/auth/github
```

### 2. Uncomment lines in `graphcool.yml` and `types.graphql`

The [`add-template`](https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/graphcool-cli/commands-aiteerae6l#graphcool-add-template) command is performing three major steps:

1. Download the source files from the [`src`](./src) directory and put them into your service's `src` directory (into a subdirectory called `email-password`).
2. Download the contents from [`graphcool.yml`](./graphcool.yml) and append them as comments to your service's `graphcool.yml`.
3. Download the contents from [`types.graphql`](./types.graphql) and append them as comments to your service's `types.graphql`.

In order for the changes to take effect, you need to manually uncomment all the lines that have been added by the `add-template` command.

### 3. Setup Github credentials

You need to configure these credentials from a new Github OAuth2 app as environment variables:

* `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
* `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`

Read more [here](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/registering-oauth-apps).

To manage your environment variables, you can use a tool like [direnv](https://direnv.net/).

### 4. Deploy the service

Finally, you need to install the [node dependencies](./package.json#L2) and apply all the changes you just made by deploying the service:

```sh
npm install
graphcool deploy
```

## Test the Code

### Obtaining a test code

First, update the configuration of the OAuth app on Github you just created:

* Set the **Homepage URL** to `http://localhost:8000/`
* Set the **Application Callback URL** to `http://localhost:8000/login.html`
* Replace `__CLIENT_ID__` in `login.html` with the **client id** of your OAuth app
* Server `login.html`, for example by using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
* Open `https://localhost:8000/login.html` in a browser, open the DevTools and authenticate with your Github account
* Copy the code printed in the Console of your DevTools

### Testing the authentication function

Go to the Graphcool Playground:

```sh
graphcool playground
```

Run this mutation to authenticate a user:

```graphql
mutation {
  # replace __GITHUB_CODE__ with the code from `login.html` from above!
  authenticateUser(githubCode: "__GITHUB_CODE__") {
    token
  }
}
```

You should see that a new user has been created. The returned token can be used to authenticate requests to your Graphcool API as that user. Note that running the mutation again with a new Github code for the same user will not add a new user.
