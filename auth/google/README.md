# google-authentication

Add Google Authentication to your Graphcool project üéÅ

## Getting Started

### 1. Add the template to your Graphcool service

```sh
graphcool add-template graphcool/templates/auth/google
```

### 2. Uncomment lines in `graphcool.yml` and `types.graphql`

The [`add-template`](https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/graphcool-cli/commands-aiteerae6l#graphcool-add-template) command is performing three major steps:

1. Download the source files from the [`src`](./src) directory and put them into your service's `src` directory (into a subdirectory called `google`).
2. Download the contents from [`graphcool.yml`](./graphcool.yml) and append them as comments to your service's `graphcool.yml`.
3. Download the contents from [`types.graphql`](./types.graphql) and append them as comments to your service's `types.graphql`.

In order for the changes to take effect, you need to manually uncomment all the lines that have been added by the `add-template` command.

### 3. Deploy the service

Finally, you need to install the [node dependencies](./package.json#L2) and apply all the changes you just made by deploying the service:

```sh
npm install
graphcool deploy
```

## Configuration

Follow the steps on https://developers.google.com/identity/ for how to work with the Google Identity Platform.
* First, create a new project:

  ![](docs/new-project.png)

* Click the `Credentials` tab to create new credentials. Choose `OAuth client ID`:

* Choose `Webapplication` as application type, and add `http://localhost:8000` as authorised JavaScript origin:

  ![](docs/create-client-id.png)

* Create a new Client ID

  ![](docs/client-id.png)

Copy the Client ID and use it to replace `__CLIENT_ID__` in `login.html`.

To create a test Google Token, run `login.html`, for example using Python's `SimpleHTTPServer`:

```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/login.html` in your browser and use the login button to create a new Google Token. It will be printed in the DevTools.

## Test the Code

First, obtain a valid Google token with the small app in `login.html` as mentioned above.

Go to the Graphcool Playground:

```sh
graphcool playground
```

Run this mutation to authenticate a user:

```graphql
mutation {
  # replace __GOOGLE_TOKEN__!
  authenticateGoogleUser(googleToken: "__GOOGLE_TOKEN__") {
    token
  }
}
```

You should see that a new user has been created. The returned token can be used to authenticate requests to your Graphcool API as that user. Note that running the mutation again with the same Google token will not add a new user.
