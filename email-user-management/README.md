Functions for email and password login using Schema Extensions and Graphcool Functions ⚡️

> Note: Schema Extensions are currently only available in the Beta Program.

## Getting Started

```sh
npm -g install graphcool
graphcool init --schema email-user-management.graphql
```

## Usage

1. Your app calls the Graphcool mutation `signupEmailUser(email: String!, password: String!)` to signup Users
2. Your app calls the Graphcool mutation `authenticateEmailUser(email: String!, password: String!)` to authenticate Users
3. Your app calls the Graphcool mutation `updateEmail(email: String!, password: String!, newEmail: String!)` to change a User's email
4. Your app calls the Graphcool mutation `updatePassword(email: String!, password: String!, newPassword: String!)` to change a User's password

## Notes

The function in this example use a Permanent Authentication Token to fetch or create users via the API so the permissions are not needed. Therefore, it's recommended to **remove Create, Update and Read permissions** for the fields `email` and `password` on `User`. Those fields are controlled by the custom mutations that are added in this example.

This also allows you to change the email or password fields using a PAT manually as an administrator. For manually updating password, note that the `password` field is hashed and salted using `bcrypt` and for authenticating or updating the user information, the current password is compared to that hashed and salted version.

## Test the Code

First, follow the READMEs to setup all the functions in the functions folder. Then go to the Graphcool Playground:

```sh
graphcool playground
```

and follow the instructions in the functions folder to test the code. It makes sense to setup the functions in the above order.
