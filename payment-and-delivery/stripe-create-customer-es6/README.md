# stripe-create-customer-es6

This example creates a new Stripe customer with Graphcool Server Side Subscription Function ⚡️

Gets triggered after a new customer is created in Graphcool and updates
it with the new Stripe customer id.

It also shows how to use webpack and babel to bring ES6 capabilities (with async/await) to Graphcool Functions!

## Getting Started

```sh
yarn
npm -g install graphcool
graphcool init --schema customer.graphql
```

## Setup Stripe, Graphcool and build the code

* You need a Stripe account so create one for free [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).

* Replace `__STRIPE_KEY__` in `src/constants.js` with your **test Stripe key**
and `__PROJECT_ID__` with your **project id**.

* In Graphcool dashboard, create a new server-side subscription function
and set `Customer` type as the trigger

* Paste the code from `subscription.graphql` to the subscription query panel

* Run `npm run build`. This will transpile the es6 code in `src/createStripeCustomer.js`
and outputs it to `dist/createStripeCustomer.js`

* Paste the code from `dist/createStripeCustomer.js` to the inline code panel.

## Test the Code

Go to the Graphcool Playground and run this mutation to create a new customer:

```graphql
mutation {
  createCustomer(email:"test@example.com") {
    id
    stripeCustomerId
    email
  }
}
```

This should return the `id` of the new customer and a null `stripeCustomerId` because
it has not been created yet. Remember, our function is triggered <u><i>after</i></u> the mutation.

Run the query below to see that our function has run and updated the new customer
node with the Stripe customer id:


```graphql
query {
  allCustomers {
    id
    stripeCustomerId
  }
}
```

This should return the new customer with a valid Stripe customer id.

## Unit tests

You can also run unit tests locally on your functions with jest. Always
a good idea before using the function in your Graphcool project!

```sh
npm t
```

Thanks so much [@yusinto](https://github.com/yusinto) for contributing this example! :tada:

> Copying pasting uglified code is pretty bad and annoying. I'll look into how we can improve this in the next iteration. Check out my blog [reactjunkie.com](http://www.reactjunkie.com) for this and more of Graphcool functions soon.
